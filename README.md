# Broker Documentation

The Broker is software used to broker (think escrow for buying and selling houses) the movement of student data from one entity to another. The iniital version of the Broker focuses on student data movement within K-12 institutions. The tech stack is modelled after the Ed-Fi ODS - ASP.NET Core with either Postgres or SQL Server for persistence.
